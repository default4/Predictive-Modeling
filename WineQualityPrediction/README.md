## Overview:

This project focuses on predictive modeling and classification analysis for wine quality. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies wine quality based on various physicochemical features. The project employs Python programming language and various popular libraries to preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies:

* Python 3.7+
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Requests

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

$ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality Dataset, which consists of various physicochemical features and quality ratings for red and white wines. The dataset can be downloaded directly using the provided URLs:

* Red Wine Quality Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv
* White Wine Quality Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv

In this script, the download_data() function downloads the Wine Quality Dataset using the provided URLs. The load_data() function reads the data and creates a pandas DataFrame. The preprocess_data() function preprocesses the data by creating a binary quality label.
